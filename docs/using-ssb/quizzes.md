Discussion and Quiz Blocks can be edited by clicking on them from the Lesson view, and are done through very similar
processes to the Lesson Blocks themselves.

## Editing a Discussion

Discussions uses the Block editor view, with a few extra options:

| Option                     | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Graded                     | Whether this activity contributes to the student’s final grade                                                                                                     |
| Allow Liking               | Whether students can ‘like’ another student’s posts                                                                                                                |
| Post before seeing replies | Students are required to post before they can see any responses to the initial post                                                                                |
| Group Discussion           | If this is a group discussion, this is a discussion board used by a particular group _inside Canvas_.                                                              |
| Peer Review                | This sets a discussion as an activity where students are tasked with answering a prompt and then responding to/reviewing [x] number of other students' submissions |

Almost none of these affect anything inside SSB (except ‘graded’), but will inform the Course Build process.

## Editing a Quiz

| Graded           | Whether this activity contributes to the student’s final grade                   |
| Time Limit       | If a time limit is set, this is how long a student can take to complete the quiz |
| Allowed Attempts | How many times a student can take/retake the quiz                                |
| Shuffle Answers  | If this is selected, the answers for each question are in a random order         |
