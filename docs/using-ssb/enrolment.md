# Course enrolment and navigation

## Viewing a course

The first time you use the Smart Storyboad, you will need to select a **Course** on the Smart Storyboard Dashboard. If you are not part of a team, you will not see any courses and will need to contact the Media team to be added.

## Course enrolment

While Teams allows access to courses in a “view only” way, to edit and contribute to a course, Users will need to enrol into a course.

To enrol into a course which you have selected, go to the Dashboard and click on the ‘Enrol’ button next to the course name:
