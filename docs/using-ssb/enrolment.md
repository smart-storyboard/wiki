# Course enrolment and navigation

## Viewing a course

The first time you use the Smart Storyboard, you will need to select a **Course** on the Smart Storyboard Dashboard. If you are not part of a team, you will not see any courses and will need to contact the Media team to be added.

## Course enrolment

While Teams allows access to courses in a “view only” way, to edit and contribute to a course, Users will need to enrol into a course.

To enrol into a course which you have selected, go to the Dashboard and click on the ‘Enrol’ button next to the course name:

## Navigation Items

**Reports**

These items at the top of the navigation hold the Dashboard (the home page of the course), your tasks (blocks and comments you have been assigned) and the Media list (a list of all of the media assets for this course).
