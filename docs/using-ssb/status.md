# Media Asset Status

Each media asset is issued with a status dropdown. This is used to move media assets through the Learning Design and
Development process, and identify the current action required for the asset.

This guide covers the use of each status dropdown for Media and Video, and who is responsible for each stage.

It is important to note that a Video Asset is still classed as a Media Item, so will have its own Media status dropdown
to move through the production process. Any associated video graphics will still be listed inside the Media Asset
Registry and use the same process.

:::infoNote
Media Asset status can only be changed from within the Media Asset Registry.

Video Production status can be changed from within the Media Asset Registry or the Video Production Storyboard Media
List.
